### About The Project

This repository documents my progress in mastering React by following the Udacity React Nanodegree curriculum. The approach is to go beyond simple exercises and build a collection of small, polished projects that are both functional and visually interesting.

The core philosophy is to create a suite of educational examples that are:
*   **Well-Documented:** Code is heavily commented to explain not just *what* is happening, but *why*, including best practices and potential quirks.
*   **Aesthetically Driven:** Each project explores a different visual theme, from retro-futurism to modern minimalism, keeping core front-end (HTML/CSS) skills sharp.
*   **Technically Curious:** Integrates animation libraries (like Anime.js) and other technologies (like shaders or 3D elements) to explore how React interacts with the broader front-end ecosystem.

This repository also serves as a personal knowledge base, containing conversation logs and notes from the learning process.

### ðŸš€ Getting Started

Currently, the initial projects are self-contained HTML files that can be run directly in a web browser without any build steps.

**To run a project:**
1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/React-School-Suite.git`
2.  Navigate to the lesson folder (e.g., `cd Lesson_01_Rendering_UI`).
3.  Open the `.html` file in your favorite web browser.

As the projects grow in complexity, they will likely require a proper development environment with Node.js and `npm`. Instructions will be updated accordingly.

### ðŸ“‚ Lesson Breakdown

#### Lesson 1: Rendering UI with React
*   **File:** [`L1_RenderingUI`](./first_lesson.html)
*   **Description:** A single-page application built using React via CDN links. It demonstrates the absolute fundamentals of getting a React component onto the screen.
*   **Aesthetic:** CRT / Retro Terminal / 80's Futurist.
*   **Key Concepts Learned:**
    *   Rendering with `React` & `ReactDOM` from a CDN.
    *   Using the Babel transpiler in-browser to handle JSX.
    *   Creating a **Functional Component**.
    *   Understanding **JSX syntax** and the use of `className` over `class`.
    *   Using the `useState` Hook to manage a component's internal state.
    *   Using the `useEffect` Hook for side effects (like setting intervals and starting animations).
    *   Properly cleaning up side effects to prevent memory leaks.
    *   Integrating a third-party library (Anime.js) within a React component's lifecycle.
